		<h2>Overview</h2>
		
		<p>This document identifies custom attribute extensions to the HTML5
			and SVG grammars implemented by the IDPF community to enable cross-Reading
			System support for behaviors.</p>
		
		<p>The attributes defined on this page have not been adopted by the EPUB Working Group, 
			and their use is not endorsed by the IDPF. They are presented here for informational 
			purposes only, and should be treated as experimental.</p>
		
		<p>This document is informative and is not tied to a particular version 
			of the EPUBÂ® specification.</p>
		
		<h2>Revision Policy</h2>
		
		<p>This document is subject to change at any time as new custom attributes are defined by
			the IDPF community. Attributes may be removed from this document if they are no longer
			supported.</p>

			<a href="https://github.com/IDPF/epub-extensions/issues">Issue Tracker</a>.</p>
